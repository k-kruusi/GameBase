Game: Connect Game

Description:
The game is is going to be similar to a Bejeweled/CandyCrush style game where you will get a row of certain items to connect and once they are connected they destroy and more items come moving down take those empty spots. Finish the level by filling up the meter before time expires to proceed to new level. As you move towards new levels, they will be harder with less chances to pass through the level. For example, having a lock on one of the items until you get the same item together to break the lock. There will be more challenges as you progress through the levels. Thereâ€™ll be a total of 3-4 levels.
