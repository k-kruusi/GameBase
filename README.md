## XPace Invaders (TBD)
*Talis Lincoln, Matthew Mazza*

### Overview:
The game we'll be building is going to be a relatively by the numbers tower defense title. Mobile is a great platform for these, hence their oversaturation in the market.  But we believe that the touch controls of mobile devices greatly enhance the gameplay in this genre, as you can see in titles like the Kingdom Rush series.

### Gameplay:
For the first assignment we'll be building the foundation of the project, this means the player base, a basic pathway for the enemies to move down, and a single type of tower that can be placed, and used to destroy the enemies.  In later assignments, and the final project we'll be introducing:
* upgrades for the towers
* more complicated paths for the enemies
* a proper resource system
* and a pathfinding AI for the enemies

### Theme:
We're basing our game in space, taking place in the far future.  The enemies will be hostile spacecraft, alien creatures, or natural problems (eg asteroids), and the lanes they use will be similar to the light speed tunnels seen in Star Wars, Guardians of the Galaxy, and similar titles.
