Ninja Star
 
              For the assignment, I decided to make a side scroller game. The game is a typical side scroller in that it starts with the character on the left side of the screen and he moves towards the right side; Different enemies come at the player and the goal is to survive by defeating these enemies. In order to win, the player must keep making progress towards the right and reach the end of the level. The player can take up to three hits from the enemy. If more than three hits are taken, the player loses and has to restart the level. I will structure the code in a way that it is comprehensive and modular.
The game will have the following features
•       Sprites
•       Animation
•       Collision
•       High score that is saved even if the player quits the app
•       Multiple views
•       Possibly multiple scenes
In addition to being a fun game, I think this game will demonstrate all the components that we learned in class.
