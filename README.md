Name: ProjectK (Temporary)

Team: Khizer Mahboob

GamePlay: You play as a swordsman.  The goal is to reflect or destroy incoming projectiles.  This is done by swiping your finger from where the projectle is coming.  Wherever the player swipes, a shield is created which reflects the projectiles and destroys the attacker.
Colliders are created wherever the swipe has been done.  Only a limited amount of shield can be created, so player cant just ceate a giant circle around the player and do nothing.  The shield goes away after a few hits, and creating a new shield destroys the orignal shield.  Also, the shield fades away after 1 second.

Theme: Futuristic with robots
