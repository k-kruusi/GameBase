# Search for the Light
By: Jessica K

Start your Game by branching off this project.
Search for the lightYou control a creature, which is round and has wings, that is in outer space searching for light orbs. You have to avoid dark objects, such as wormholes or anything that has a dark outline. You will be stationed at the bottom of the screen and objects will be coming towards you from the top of the screen. When you grab enough light orbs you will be able to have a defense around yourself so if you were to hit anything you wouldnâ€™t receive any damage.

Controls for the creature will be at the bottom of the screen and if the payer were to run into anything too massive to avoid/dodge then the player would either have to have the shield or they could tap on it enough times to destroy it themselves.

Controls include moving left right and dashing to either destroy objects or to quickly avoid them.

The game would also include a scrolling background of outer space that would be created with particle systems.
