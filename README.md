2D Endless Platformer
Endless Platformer that continuously spawns random platforms that the player would need to traverse in order to get as far as possible. The way the player moves from platform to platform is by launching the character similar to how Angry Birds launches its birds.
So to go into detail, the player pulls back from the start point of the character's location and launches it in the direction that they want to go. They can only launch again once the character lands on a platform. The player goes from platform to platform as far as they can while trying to get a high score. The game is played from a top down view.
Theme of the game is that you play as a frog that leaps from lily pad to lily pad (platform to platform), collecting as many flies as you can. If you miss a platform and fall in the water below you'll have only a few seconds to get back on a platform before a snake swims up and eats you.
