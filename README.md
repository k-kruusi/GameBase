# Virus Conquest Game Proposal
By Paul Ly and Joshua Isaacs

This is a simple real-time tactical multiplayer game which is similar to the board game, Risk. There can only be two players in this game on a local split-screen setup. The way this game works is the each players have a main base to start off with. The objective of this game is to capture the enemy’s main base by sending enough units to the enemy’s main base.

X = Player 1

o = Player 2

[] = Uncaptured Territory

\ or / = Lines

**Example Map Layout:**


```
________________________
|                       |
|           x           |
|        /     \        |
|      /         \      |
|    []           []    |
|      \         /      |
|        \    /         |
|          o            |
|_______________________|

```
**Mechanics:**
Each controlled bases will automatically generate a unit per second up to 10 units. You can send unit to any direction that the player choose based on the highlighted lines by touching and holding your finger onto the main base. Battle will occur if both armies clashing for the objective. Number advantage will win.
