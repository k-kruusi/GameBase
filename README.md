# Eric's Game
## Mobile Programming

This is a simple space shooter that uses the accelerometer to steer. It features:

* Sprites
* Accelerometer control
* Menu progression
* Scoring
* And much more!

The goal of the game is to get as high a score as you can before 3 aliens pass the player ship. Once you run out of lives, you can reset the game.

The game has two difficulty modes: Easy and Hard. They are both the same in terms of gameplay, except enemies spawn more frequently on hard mode.
