# Block Frenzy

Members: David McLoughlin, Arsin Youkhana

A Modern take on the classic 1970s game brick break. Where the player controllers a platform where the projectile bounces off of and smashes into different sets of targets and obstacles.

A few obstacles that we will be implementing will be “block movement” where the blocks will try to avoid the projectile. We will also be adding a few unique properties to some of the block targets such as; shapeshifting blocks, armored blocks, flipping the game screen, and unbreakable blocks that hinder the player, for example when the projectile bounces off the unbreakable block it will either speed up for slow down.

We are also planning on implementing different game modes as well in particular classic, time attack, and “Fun” Mode.
