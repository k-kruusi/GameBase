# Warrior of Leporia - Mobile Edition

This game is a 2D platformer on iOs. Players will play as a rabbit warrior called B-Rabbit.
You must fight through a stronghold of human enemies and defeat the boss. This game is similar to
a typical platformer game like Mario or Megaman.

Players can walk and jump by tapping arrow buttons on the screen. Tapping the screen (and not the arrow buttons) will do an attack.
There are two types of attacks, air attack and ground attacks.
Multiple tapping of attacks will do combinations that do more damage.
There are various enemies that you must face off against, both melee and ranged enemies.

There will be some enemies that have unique AI behaviours as well as a final boss fight.
There are no powerups for this game. But you can collect health
pickups that drop when you kill enemies sometimes. 

This game has already been published for PC on itch.io. There is also gameplay footage available
and you can download the game too.

This mobile version of the game will be much better! Enjoy!
